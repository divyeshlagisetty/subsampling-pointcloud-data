## About

Subsampling in 3D point clouds is crucial for managing computational demands and memory usage while preserving vital features. Techniques vary in biases toward major or minor classes. A hybrid approach is sought, combining methods to optimize retention of minor class points, predicting removal amounts for each technique to amplify their presence.

## Usage

There are four python files in this project.  
1. point_cloud_utils.py: Python file containing functions for subsampling methods.
2. Divyesh_random_subsampling.py: Python file implementing the Random subsampling method.
3. Divyesh_space_based_subsampling.py: Python file implementing the Space-Based subsampling method.
4. Divyesh_voxel_based_subsampling.py: Python file implementing the Voxal subsampling method.
5. The AI project report contains the analysis of the various above-mentioned subsampling methods.
